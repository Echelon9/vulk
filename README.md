## What is it ?

Vulk is a 3d engine aimed to provide the best graphical experience with Vulkan API.
It is written in Python with C binding and is based on SDL2.

## What is the project goal ?

- Easy to use: you don't need to understand Vulkan to use VULK.
- Modular: every single part of the api must be modular.
- Full: you shouldn't need to customize core code, it should suits everyone needs.
